#  🕹️ level 0 
This is the simplest level of all in this level you just have login with ssh . For SSH harderning the lab just changed default port 22 to 2220 port which can easily encounter by 
```bash...
ssh -p 2220 username@ip/dns 
```
for me it was 
```bash...
ssh -p 2220 bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
```
and after entering the password its done you are welcome to the lab.
