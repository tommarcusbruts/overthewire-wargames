# level1 -> level2

## problem 
on this level the password is save in a file called "-". if you directly cat it or nano it a new file will open . because "-" is in linux is interpreted as standard input (stdin)

## logic to solve
on this level use "./" beside cat to avoide confusion with linux commands and file names .this can also view the content of the "-" file.
